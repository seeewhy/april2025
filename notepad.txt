Installing on Windows
There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. 
Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. 
Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

Some people may instead find it useful to install Git from source, because youâ€™ll get the most recent version. The binary installers tend to be a bit behind, though as Git has matured in recent years, this has made less of a difference.
